The wagon creaks.
Shadow hide you.
Ah... you are from the Fighters Guild, I resume. Good show. I am Lord Rugdumph gro-Shurgak. Let us conversate on the Lady Rogbut. I fear that whilst out rock-picking, she was apprehensive. Stolen away! My suspension is that ogres have abjected her! Please search to the east of my sprawling abode. They have been known to vacate these premises. I am most gracious and truly woeful.
Horrible creatures! Replete with horror and evil. They roam freely eastward of the estate. I look forward to you exterminizing them.
Please, rescue my daughter from these brutes! I fear for her safe return!
Precedeth most urgentlike.
You found my belabored daughter! I will tell Burz gro-Khash about your indentures! Take this. It has been passed in my family for many generators.
Words cannot express my gratification for your help.
Trolls, I have been foretold, are particular to unflammable weapons.
The will-o-the-wisp is a luminous being. It has naturalized residences to many types of spells.
I am resident to encounter the minotaur. Its horny protuberants cause me great conflagrations.
Though I am replicant to spread rumors, I am led to believe the philogy of skeletous beings makes them resistive to magic.
Speaketh you on.
Hither to me, good varlet.
We are so very sooth.
Go to, bold fighterperson.
In sooth, mostly goodly done.
Anon us most soon again, for sooth.
We is most pleased... eth... ified.
I see you are a follower of the Gray Fox.
Shadow hide you.
I see you are a follower of the Gray Fox.
Away with you vile beggar!
Well met!
You've got some nimble fingers. What have you been getting them into?
You're a fit one, been running a lot?
By the nine divines! You're the grand champion, this is truly an honour!!
Look at the muscles on you!
Eh?
 You've got a bounce to your step. I bet you're quite the acrobat.
You're a sneaky looking sort..
By the gods, there's a psychopath on the loose!
Why... won't... you... die?!
Eh?
This is the part where you fall down and bleed to death!
I've fought mudcrabs more fearsome than you!
I shall drink from your skull.
Stop right there, criminal scum!
I SHALL DRINK FROM YOUR SKULL!
What do you need, citizen?

 Good day, citizen.
 Keep moving, scum!
 Someone's been murdered!
 Duty calls.
Why...why its you, the hero of Kvatch! It is truly an honor.

Stop **CLICKING ME!**
Stop! You have violated the law! Pay the court a fine or serve your sentence.
Then pay with your blood!
 Here's the procedure. We go to the castle. First we search you, confiscate any stolen goods. Then you pay your fine, and we release you.
Hope you rot.
Away with you vile beggar!
Eh?
 *Gasp* Oh my goodness! Excuse me, are you all right?
The body's still warm. Looks like there's a killer about.
 May he rest in peace.
All hail the champion of Cyrodiil!
It is truly an honor.
 You. I've seen your kind before. You've got blood on your hands. Keep your blade sheathed, you murdering bastard, or I'll put you down myself.
 I'm here to relieve you.
Guilty!
YOU SHOULD'VE PAID THE FINE!
Fall down and die.
The wagon creaks.
No sweet without sweat.
It's almost harvesting season.
Eh?
Away with you vile beggar!
